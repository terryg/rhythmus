ABOUT

   Rhythmus is an algorithm which determines the stress patterns in 
   English poetry.  

   rhythmus.rb parses a plain text file.  It outputs to standard out
   the provisional rankings for the syllables of each line.  The
   output is in HTML format.  Rhythmus comes with a dictionary file
   (rhythmus.dict), this file is consulted to find provisional
   rankings.  If the file being parsed contains words not in the
   dictionary, the user is queried to supply the syllables and
   provisional rankings.  Rhythmus updates the dictionary file after
   each use with newly acquired entries.  Currently, Rhythmus does not
   support multiple entries per word.

   Syllables and provisional rankings should be entered in the
   following format: 'syl/lab/les 123' Use a backslash '/' to delimit
   syllables, then a space, then a string of the rankings.  There
   should be one digit per syllable.  Provisional rankings may be [1..3].
